# InApp Notifications SDK

An Android SDK that lets you show in-app notification dialogs to users. The notifications are managed through a backend and admin portal, so you can create and control them without releasing a new app version.

This was built as a course project to learn Android SDK development, REST APIs, and Firebase.

## Demo Video

[▶ Watch Demo Video](https://github.com/NivIvri/InAppNotificationsSDK/releases/download/demo/Screen_recording_20260627_135021.webm)

The demo shows:
- **Image notifications** — a notification with a banner image on the Home screen
- **Audience targeting** — the Shop screen shows a different notification for Regular vs Premium users
- **Show-once** — the Profile screen notification appears only on the first visit
- **Reset** — clearing seen notifications from Settings makes the show-once notification appear again

---

## Main Features

- Show a notification dialog on any screen in an Android app
- Filter notifications by screen and user type (regular / premium)
- Date range support — notifications only show between start and end dates
- Show-once mode — a notification won't appear again after the user dismisses it
- Tracks how many times each notification was viewed and clicked
- Admin portal to create, edit, activate/deactivate, and delete notifications

---

## Technologies

- **Android SDK** — Kotlin, Retrofit, SharedPreferences
- **Backend** — Python, Flask, Flask-CORS
- **Database** — Google Firestore
- **Admin Portal** — Plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Deployment** — Vercel (configured but not deployed)

## How to Run the Backend

1. Get your Firebase service account key from Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service Accounts → Generate new private key
2. Save it as `backend/serviceAccountKey.json`
3. Open a terminal in the `backend/` folder

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat      # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Server runs at `http://localhost:5000`

## Admin Portal

The admin portal is a web interface for managing notifications without touching code or the database directly. It lets you create, edit, and control notifications in real time.

**What you can do from the portal:**
- Create a new notification with a title, message, target screen, audience, date range, and optional image URL
- Edit any existing notification
- Activate or deactivate notifications instantly — changes reflect in the app without a release
- Delete notifications
- See view and click counts for every notification

**How to open it:**

Make sure the backend is running first, then open the file directly in your browser:

```
admin-portal/index.html
```

The portal connects to `http://localhost:5000`.

---

## How to Run the Android App

1. Open the project in Android Studio
2. In `app/src/main/.../demo/MainActivity.kt`, make sure `BASE_URL` points to your backend:
   - Emulator: `http://10.0.2.2:5000/`
   - Real device: use your computer's local IP, e.g. `http://192.168.1.x:5000/`
3. Run the app on an emulator or device

---

## SDK Usage Example

```kotlin
// 1. Initialize once (e.g. in MainActivity)
NotificationSdk.initialize("http://10.0.2.2:5000/")

// 2. Call on any screen to show a relevant notification
NotificationSdk.checkAndShow(this, "home", "premium")

// 3. Reset seen notifications (e.g. in Settings)
NotificationSdk.clearSeenNotifications(this)
```

**Parameters for `checkAndShow`:**
- `activity` — the current Activity
- `screen` — name of the current screen (must match `targetScreen` in the notification)
- `userType` — `"regular"` or `"premium"` (must match `audience` in the notification)

---

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/notifications?screen=&userType=` | Get active notifications for a screen |
| GET | `/api/notifications/<id>` | Get a single notification |
| POST | `/api/notifications` | Create a notification |
| PUT | `/api/notifications/<id>` | Update a notification |
| PATCH | `/api/notifications/<id>/activate` | Activate |
| PATCH | `/api/notifications/<id>/deactivate` | Deactivate |
| PATCH | `/api/notifications/<id>/view` | Increment view counter |
| PATCH | `/api/notifications/<id>/click` | Increment click counter |
| DELETE | `/api/notifications/<id>` | Delete |
| GET | `/api/admin/notifications` | Get all notifications (admin only) |

---

## Known Limitations

- The backend has no authentication — anyone with the URL can call the API
- `showOnce` is stored on the device (SharedPreferences), not tied to a user account. Reinstalling the app resets it
- Date filtering uses string comparison (`YYYY-MM-DD`), not proper datetime objects
- Only one notification is shown per screen visit (the first valid one)
- The backend is not deployed — it only runs locally
- No error messages shown to the user if the network request fails
- Not tested on older Android versions (minSdk is 28)
